# Machine-Learning__Stroke-Risk-Prediction-Model

I.Objective
To establish an efficient machine learning predictive model aimed at the early identification of high-risk stroke groups. 

II. Data Features & Preprocessing
Key Input Variables (Inputs):

Physiological Indicators: Age, Gender, History of Hypertension, History of Heart Disease, Average Blood Glucose Level, and BMI.

Lifestyle: Marital Status, Occupation, Residence Type (Urban/Rural), and Smoking Status.

Predictive Output: Stroke Status (1: Yes / 0: No).

Preprocessing Techniques:

Missing Value Handling: Applied Mean Imputation for missing BMI values.

Variable Transformation: Conducted Numerical Encoding for categorical data (e.g., occupation, smoking status) to facilitate algorithmic computation.

III. Methodology & Validation
Validation Mechanism: Utilized an 80/20 Train-Test Split (80% for training, 20% for testing).

Algorithms Compared: Conducted a comparative analysis of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

IV. Research Results & Findings
Best Performance: Empirical results demonstrate that the ANN (Artificial Neural Network) achieved the superior predictive performance on the test set.

Key Predictors: Data analysis indicates that Age, Hypertension, and Average Blood Glucose Level are the most critical indicators for predicting stroke risk.

Evaluation Metrics: A comprehensive performance evaluation was conducted using Confusion Matrices, Precision, Recall, and the AUC (Area Under the Curve).

V. Conclusion & Application Value
Big data and machine learning technologies can effectively identify high-risk stroke populations, providing essential clinical decision support. This achieves the core values ​​of early warning and proactive health management.
